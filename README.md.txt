This project performs T-test, Z-test and F-test on the Students Performance dataset taken from Kaggle.

## Dataset
File: StudentsPerformance.csv

## Tests performed
- Independent Two-sample T-test
- Z-test
- F-test (variance ratio)

## Tools used
- Google Colab
- Python
- Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Statsmodels

## Results Summary
- T-test and Z-test results show a significant difference between Math and Reading scores.
- F-test shows the variance ratio between scores.

## How to run
1. Upload StudentsPerformance.csv to Colab
2. Run the notebook
3. Results are printed in output

If p-value < 0.05 → Reject null hypothesis (Significant difference)

If p-value ≥ 0.05 → Fail to reject null (No significant difference)
